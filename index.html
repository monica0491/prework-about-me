      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Curiosity has been my main driver as a professional. It allowed me to learn 4 different languages (Spanish, English, German and Portuguese), live in 3 different countries (Costa Rica, Germany, and the US) and pursue multiple, yet complementary career paths including; Intellectual Property Law, Business, Marketing, and Technology.

My main interest as a professional lies in being able to deliver and communicate the value add that customized technology solutions can create for customers, by optimizing their business processes, reducing costs or maximizing revenue.

By working together with Sales Leaders and Technologist I would love to deliver solutions that not only have a tremendous impact on the bottom line but also are good for the world!
